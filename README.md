## `npm run` scripts

There are a few defined run scripts, here's a list of them with a description of what they do. To run them, simply execute `npm run <script name>` - e.g. `npm run dev`

* `start`: Used by the production environment to start the app. This will run a compiled version, so you need to execute `build` first.
* `build`: Runs the `babel` CLI to compile the app. Files are emitted to `dist/`.
* `dev`: Runs the app in development mode - uses `babel-node` to compile on-the-fly. Also uses `nodemon` to automatically restart when stuff changes.
* `debug`: Runs the app in development mode with `icebug` (a combo of `nodemon` + `node-inspector`). (quite buggy actually)
* `test`: Runs `mocha` tests.
* `test-watch`: Runs `mocha` tests in watch-mode.
* `lint`: Lints the code in `src` and `test` with `eslint`.
* `lint-watch`: Same as above, in watch-mode.

**Tip**: to pass additional arguments to the actual CLI's being called, do it like in this example:

```bash
npm run test -- --debug
```

*Note the __`--`__ before the actual arguments.*
